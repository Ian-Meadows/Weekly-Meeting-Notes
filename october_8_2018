Agile Standup/ Retrospective Meeting Summary:

1) Completions since last meeting: In terms of actual tasks, our group has been able to outline the specific tasks which need to be completed. However, we were not able to assign specific tasks to project members during our previous meeting so that was one of our goals for this week.

2) Completion goals before the next meeting: One of the goals that we intend on accomplishing this week is the creation of our project management tool as well as timelining the specific tasks which need to be completed. In terms of our task goal this week, the team is focusing on completing a design layout for the main page of our website. The main page of the website will consist of login functionality as well (combining as both a main page and login page). Our design will consist of sketching and coding a basic layout for the page (html). 

3) Obstacles: in terms of the main page design layout, our obstacles consist of the specific pages we want to include in our main tab which will be at the top of the page (with the login). We are not sure whether it would be a good decision to include a comprehensive games tab vs a live games tab so our obstacles arise from choosing a layout which is simple and easy for the user.
